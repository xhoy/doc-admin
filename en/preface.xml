customer users.

Although many hours of work, some litres of coffee and several pizzas were
invested into the following sections, it is still not complete. Inevitably
there will be errors, parts with complicated explanations or missing chapters about
important things. Some chapters will be reworked or new
chapters and sections will be added.
