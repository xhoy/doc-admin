<title>S/MIME</title>

<para>
At first sight, encryption with S/MIME seems to be a little bit more
complicated than encryption with PGP. First of all, you have to establish
a Certification Authority (CA) for the OTRS system. Then, the following
procedures are very much like those you have to perform using PGP:
configure OTRS, install your own certificate, import other public
certificates if needed etc.
</para>

<para>
The S/MIME configuration is conducted outside the OTRS web interface for
the most part, and should be carried out in a shell by the OTRS user, i.e.
with his/her user rights. The MIME configuration under Linux is based on
SSL (OpenSSL). Therefore, check first of all whether the OpenSSL package
is installed on your system. The OpenSSL package includes a script called
CA.pl with which the most important steps of certificate creation can be
performed. To simplify the procedure, find out where in the file system
the CA.pl script is stored and enter the location temporarily into the path
variable of the shell.

otrs@linux:~/tmp&gt;
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The example shows that a new temporary directory ~/tmp has been created in
which the certificate is generated.
</para>

<para>
To create a certificate, perform the following operations in the command
line (we assume that the OTRS administrator has to create a SSL
certificate for test and learning purposes. In case you already have a
certified SSL certificate for the encryption, use it and skip the
following):

Here you can activate the S/MIME support, define the paths for the OpenSSL
command and the directory for the certificates. The key file created above
must be stored in the directory indicated here. Otherwise OpenSSL cannot
use it.

and the public keys of other communication partners. Enter the public key
that has been created in the beginning of this section and has been added
in OTRS.

<para>
Obviously, all public S/MIME keys of communication partners can be
imported using the
