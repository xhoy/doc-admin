    <title>Generic Interface Layers</title>
    <para>
        Generic Interface is build based on a layer model, to be flexible and easy to customize.
    </para>
    <para>
        A layer is a set of files, which control how the Generic Interface performs different parts
        of a web service. Using the right configuration one can build different web services for
        different External Systems without creating new modules.
    </para>
    <note>
        <para>
            If the Remote System does not support the current bundled modules of the Generic
            Interface, special modules need to be developed for that specific web service.
        </para>
        <para>
            The list of provided Generic Interface modules shipped with OTRS will be updated and
            increased over time.

    <section>
        <title>Network Transport</title>
        <para>
            This layer is responsible for the correct communication with the Remote System.
            It receives requests and generates responses when acting as provider, and generates
            requests and receives responses when acting as requester.
        </para>
        <para>
            Provider communication is handled by a new web server handle called
            "nph-genericinterface.pl".
        </para>
        <para>
            Requester communication could be initiated during an event triggered by
            a Generic Interface module or any other OTRS module. This event is catched by the
            event handler and depending on the configuration the event will be processed
            directly by the requester object or delegated to the
            Scheduler (a separated deamon designed to process tasks asynchronously).
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Data Mapping</title>
        <para>
            This layer is responsible for translating data structures between OTRS and the
            Remote System (data internal and data external layers). Usually Remote Systems have
            different data structures than OTRS (including different values and names for those
            values), and here resides the importance of the layer to change the received
            information into something that OTRS can understand and on the opposite way send
            the information to each Remote System using their data dictionaries.
        </para>
        <para>
            <remark>Example: </remark>
                "Priority" (OTRS) might be called "Prio" in a remote system and it could be that
                value "1 Low" (OTRS) should be mapped to "Information" on the remote system.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
    <title>Controller</title>
        <para>
            Controllers are collections of similar Operations or Invokers. For example, a
            Ticket controller might contain several standard ticket operations. Custom
            controllers can be implemented, for example a "TicketExternalCompany" controller
            which may contain similar functions as the standard Ticket controller, but with a
            different data interface, or function names (to adapt to the Remote System function
            names) or complete different code.
        </para>
        <para>
            One application for Generic Interface could be to synchronize information with one
            Remote System that only can talk with another Remote System of the same kind. In
            this case new controllers needs to be developed and the Operations and Invokers has
            to emulate the Remote System behavior in such way that the interface that OTRS exposes
            is similar to the Remote System's interface.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Operation (OTRS as a provider)</title>
        <para>
            An Operation is a single action that can be performed within OTRS. All operations
            have the same programming interface, they receive the data into one specific
            parameter, and return a  data structure with a success status, potential error
            message and returning data.
        </para>
        <para>
            Normally operations uses the already mapped data (internal) to call core modules and
            perform actions in OTRS like: Create a Ticket, Update a User, Invalidate a Queue,
            Send a Notification, etc. An operation has full access to the OTRS API to perform
            the action.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Invoker (OTRS as a requester)</title>
        <para>
            An Invoker is an action that OTRS performs against a Remote System. Invokers
            use the OTRS Core modules to process and collect the needed information to create
            the request. When the information is ready it has to be mapped to the Remote System
            format in order to be sent to the Remote System, that will process the information
            execute the action and send the response back, to either process the success or
            handle errors.
