        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
            This feature of OTRS allows you to model processes (workflows) in the ticket system.
            The basic idea is to be able to define reoccurring processes, and to delegate work items
            to different people, as well as leading the progress of a process in different directions
            based on certain criteria.
        </para>

    <section>
        <title>Example process</title>
        <para>
            Let's see an example to make it more demonstrative. We will define a book order process:
        </para>

        <section>
            <title>Recording the demand</title>
            <para>
                Before an order will be placed, the demand for literature by an employee will be recorded.
                The following book is needed in our example:
            </para>
            <para>
                <screen>
Title: Prozessmanagement für Dummies
Autor: Thilo Knuppertz
ISBN: 3527703713
                </screen>
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Approval by superior</title>
            <para>
                The head of the employee's department needs to decide on the order.
                In case of a denial, a reason should be recorded by the superior.
                In case of approval, the order is passed to the purchasing department.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Processing by purchasing department</title>
            <para>
                Purchasing now has the task to find out where the book can be ordered with the best conditions.
                If it is out of stock, this can be recorded in the order.
                In case of a successful order purchasing will record the supplier, the price and the delivery date.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Processing by the mailroom</title>
            <para>
                The shipment will arrive at the company. The incoming goods department checks the shipment and records the date of receipt.
                Now the employee will be informed that their order has arrived and is ready to be collected.
            </para>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Implementing the example</title>
        <para>
            If we assume that a ticket acts in this workflow like an accompanying document that can receive change notes,
            we already have a clear picture of process tickets.
        </para>
        <para>
            From the analysis of the example process we can identify the following neccessary items:
        </para>
        <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>Possiblities to record data, let's call them <emphasis>Activity Dialogs</emphasis>,</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>checks which can react to changed data automatically, let's call them <emphasis>Transitions</emphasis>,</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>changes which can be applied to a process ticket after successful transitions of a process ticket, let's call them <emphasis>Transition Actions</emphasis>.</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>
            We also need an additional item which might not be as obvious:
        </para>
        <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        A possibility to offer more than just one Activity Dialog to be available.
                        In our example this is needed when the superior must have the choice between "Approve" and "Deny".
                        Let's call this <emphasis>Activity</emphasis>.
                </para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>
            Now, with Activities, Activity Dialogs, Transitions and Transition Actions we have the neccessary tools to model
            the individual steps of our example.
            To be able to refer to these entities later, we will assign to them an abbreviation in parentheses.
        </para>

        <para>
            What's still missing is an area where for each workflow the order of the steps can be specified.
            Let's call this <emphasis>Process</emphasis>.
        </para>

        <para>
            In the next step, we will define the individual entities that we need.
        </para>

                            An activity dialog which makes it possible for purchasing to reject an impossible order (book out of stock).
                            Here we also need a comment field and the status field with the option "Order denied".

                <para>
                    As you can see, there are places where the same TransitionAction should be executed.
                    Therefore it is reasonable to make it possible to link TransitionActions freely with
                    Transitions to be able to reuse them.
                </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Activities</title>
            <para>
                We chose the approach to see Activities as a basket which can contain one
                or more Activity Dialogs.
                We need these Activities for our example:
            </para>
            <para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Recording the demand (A1):
                        Contains the Activity Dialog "Recording the demand"</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Approval (A2):
                        Contains the Activity Dialogs "Approval denied" as well as "Approved"</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Order (A3):
                        Contains the Activity Dialogs "Order denied" as well as "Order placed"</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Incoming (AS):
                        Contains the Activity Dialog "Shipment received"</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Process complete (A5):
                            This is an Activity without possible ActivityDialogs.
                            It will be set after "Approval denied", "Order denied" or "Shipment received"
                            and represents the end of the process.
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
            </para>
            <para>
                Now we can clearly see that Activities are precisely defined states of a process ticket.
                After a successful Transition a process ticket moves from one Activity to another.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Book ordering Process</title>
            <para>
                Let us conclude our example with the last missing piece in the puzzle, the Process.
                In our case this is the whole ordering workflow. Other processes could be office supply ordering
                or completely different processes.
            </para>

            <para>
                The process has a starting point which consists of the start Activity and the start Activity Dialog.
                For any new book order, the start Activity Dialog is the first screen that is displayed.
                If this is completed and saved, the Process ticket will be created and can follow the configured
                workflow.
            </para>

            <para>
                The process also contains the directions for how the process ticket can move through the Process. Let's call this the
                "Path". It consists of the start Activity, one or more Transitions (possibly with Transition Actions),
                and other Activities.
            </para>

            <para>
                Action 'A1' is a defined state of the process ticket, where there is the possibility for the Transition 'T1'.
                If this applies, the ticket will move to the next Activity 'A2', and the TransitionActions 'TA1' and 'TA2' are executed.
                In Activity 'A2', the Activity Dialogs 'AD2' (Approval denied) and 'AD3' (Approved) are available.

                <title>Path</title>
                <para>
                    The Path contains the structure of the Activities and the possible Transitions between
                    them, for the current process. This controls the way that a process ticket can take. Example:
                </para>
                <para>
                <screen>
'A1' => {
    'T1' => {
        ActivityEntityID => 'A2',
    },
    'T2' => {
        ActivityEntityID => 'A3',
    },
    'T3' => {
        ActivityEntityID => 'A4',
        TransitionAction => ['TA1', 'TA2'],
    },
},
                </screen>
                </para>
                <para>
                    If a process ticket is in Activity 'A1', it has three possible ways to get to another Activity.
                    In the Transitions 'T1' to 'T3', conditions are defined, that a process ticket must fulfil to
                    move (transit) to another Activity.
                </para>
                <para>
                    If in this case all the values of the process ticket and its dynamic fields that are needed for the
                    Transition 'T2' are correct, the ticket will be moved from Activity 'A1' to 'A3'. After an ActivityDialog
                    is submitted, or any other change is made to a ticket, it will be checked for possible Transitions from
                    the current Activity. If multiple Transitions are possible, the first one will be used (based on nummerical
                    sorting of the TransitionIDs).
                </para>
                <para>
                    Additionally, it is possible to assign TransitionActions to Transitions in the Path configuration.
                    These are modules which are executed after a successful Transition. They have to be specified in array form
                    as in the example, we'll talk about the details later.

                An Activity contains one or more ActivityDialogs and models a 'step' in the process.
                All ActivityDialogs of the current Activity are displayed in the ticket zoom and can be
                used until the conditions of a Transition are fulfilled.

                <para>
                    The field "Article" is a special case. If it is present in a "Fields" configuration, the ActivityDialog
                    will contain a complete Richtext editor with subject field and attachment handling.
                    The entered text will then be added to the ticket as an article and sent by email.
                    Let's see an example Article field configuration:
                    <screen>
Article => {

                                    '0': field is invisible. This can be helpful if field values should automatically be set.
                                    The configured DefaultValue will be stored in this case.

                        For fields with 'ID' (like QueueID, OwnerID), this refers to the database ID of the value.
                        For other fields without 'ID' (like Queue, Owner), the DefaultValue must contain the value itself. Example:
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        <screen>

                    Here the display order of the fields is configured.
                    IMPORTANT: Invisible fields also must be configured here, because only configured fields will be considered
                    when saving. Fields which are not configured will not be saved.

            <para>
                A Transition decides - based on configurable conditions - which path in the Process
                is taken, i. e. to which Activity a Process ticket can be moved.

                                    'Regex': The field value can be tested with a regular expression. It is important that
                                    'Match' contains qr{}xms as a base condition. Between the braces the actual regular expression
                                    can be noted.

            <para>
                TransitionActions sind Erweiterungen des OTRSTicketProcesses die nach erfolgreich durchgeführten Transitions angestoßen werden.
                Über TransitionActions können alle möglichen Veränderungen am Auftragsticket wie z.b. Queue Move oder Owner Change durchgeführt werden.
                Weiters lassen sich auf Wunsch TransitionActions erstellen die Emails versenden können oder andere automatisierbare Vorgänge
                nach erfolgreicher Transition durchführen.

                    Was hier konfiguriert wird, hängt von den Anforderungen des jeweiligen TransitionAction Moduls ab.
                    Siehe hierzu die Dokumentation der einzelnen TransitionAction Module. Im obigen Beispiel des
                    QueueMove ist nur die Angabe der TargetQueue nötig.

                    dem Namen des DynamicField steht. Es ist zwingend notwending, dass das definierte
                    DynamicField im OTRS System hinterlegt und valide ist.

                    DynamicFieldMapping definiert die Fallentscheidung anhand der der Status des
                    Auftragsticket entschieden wird. Für jeden definierten Wert ist es nötig einen State oder
                    eine StateID anzugeben. Diese verhalten sich analog zu den fest definierten State und
                    StateID Parametern, die bereits im oberen Teil beschrieben wurden. Falls keiner der
                    definierten Werte zutreffen sollte wird der Status des Auftragstickets nicht verändert.

                <para>
                    Hier kann ein Array von Activity Dialog IDs angegeben werden. Dieses Array schränkt bei zutreffen der Properties Bedingung die Auswahl der
                    in der Zoom Maske angezeigten Activity Dialogs ein.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Possible gibt die Liste der erlaubten Activity Dialogs an.
                    Sind z. B. für das aktuelle Activity folgende Activity Dialogs konfiguriert: 'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3' (einstellbar in der Activity Konfiguration)
                    schränkt die obige Konfiguration die Auswahlmöglichkeit auf die Activity Dialogs 'AD1' und 'AD3' ein.
                </para>
                <para>
                    PossibleNot gibt die Liste der nicht erlaubte Activity Dialogs an.
                    Sind z. B. für das aktuelle Activity folgende Activity Dialogs konfiguriert: 'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3' (einstellbar in der Activity Konfiguration)
                    schränkt die obige Konfiguration die Auswahlmöglichkeit auf die Activity Dialogs 'AD1' und 'AD2' ein.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Wird wie oben sowohl Possible als auch PossibleNot angegeben, durchläuft die Ermittlung der möglichen Activity Dialog folgende Logik:
                    Konfigurierte ActivityDialogs: 'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3'. Nach Prüfung auf Possible verbleiben die Möglichkeiten 'AD1' und 'AD3'.
                    Danach setzt PossibleNot ein und nimmt auch noch 'AD3' aus der Liste der möglichen ActivityDialogs.
                    Übrig bleibt als einzige erlaubte Activity Dialog 'AD1'.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Weiters werden die erlaubten Activity Dialogs als Schnittmenge aller zutreffender ACL Regeln,
                    die "Activity" unter Possible oder PossibleNot konfiguriert haben, ermittelt. Beispiel:
                </para>
                <para>
                    Konfigurierte Activity Dialogs: 'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3', 'AD4', 'AD5', 'AD6', 'AD7'

                },
            };
            $Self->{TicketAcl}->{'003-ACL-Priority'} = {

            };
                    </screen>
                </para>
                <para>
                    Angenommen das Auftragsticket hat den Status 'new', ist in der 'Raw' Queue und hat als Priority '3 normal'
                    treffen alle drei obigen ACL Rules zu.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Die erste ACL Rule reduziert die erlaubten Activity Dialogs von 'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3', 'AD4', 'AD5', 'AD6', 'AD7' auf
                    'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3', 'AD6', 'AD7' und verbietet somit 'AD4' und 'AD5'.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Die zweite ACL Rule reduziert die erlaubten Activity Dialogs von den nach der ersten ACL verbleibenden:
                    'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3', 'AD6', 'AD7' auf die Activity Dialogs die sowohl in der ersten als auch in der zweiten Regel unter Possible zu finden sind.
                    In unserem Beispiel verbleiben somit 'AD2', 'AD3', 'AD7'. Die Activity Dilalog 'AD1' fällt heraus, da sie nur in der ersten Regel definiert ist.
                    Die Activity Dialog 'AD4' wird nicht in die erlaubten Activity Dialogs aufgenommen, da sie nur in der zweiten Regel definiert ist.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Nach der Reduktion der möglichen Activity Dialogs durch Possible setzt die weitere Reduktion durch PossibleNot ein.
                    In unserem Fall versucht sie die Activity Dialog 'AD3' zu verhindern, welche nach den Possibles noch vorhanden war.
                    Das Verbot von 'AD4' wirkt sich nicht aus, da diese schon vorher herausgefallen war.
                    Somit verbleiben nach PossibleNot 'AD2' und 'AD7' als mögliche Activity Dialogs.
