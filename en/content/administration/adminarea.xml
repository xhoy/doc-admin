<para>
The following system configuration settings are available to OTRS administrators by accessing the Admin page of the OTRS web interface
- adding agents, customers and queues, ticket and mail settings, installing additional packages such as FAQ and ITSM, and much more.</para>

<para>
Agents who are members of the <emphasis>admin</emphasis> group can access the Admin area by clicking the <emphasis>Admin</emphasis> link in the navigation bar (see Figure below). Agents without sufficiently elevated access rights will not be able to access this link.

<section id="adminarea-roles">
<title>Roles</title>

<para>
Roles are a powerful feature to manage the access rights of many agents in a very simple and quick manner. They are particularly useful for large, complex support systems with a lot of agents, groups and queues. An example below explains when they should be used.
</para>

<para>
Suppose that you have a system with 100 agents, 90 of them with access to a single queue called "support" where all support requests are handled. The "support" queue contains multiple sub queues. The other 10 agents have permission to access all queues of the system. These 10 agents dispatch tickets, watch the raw queue and move spam messages into the "junk" queue.
</para>

<para>
The company now opens a new department that sells some products. Order request and acceptance, order confirmation, bills, etc. must be processed, and some of the company's agents are supposed to do this using OTRS. The different agents have to get access to the new queues that must be created.
</para>

<para>
Because it would take a long time to change the access rights for the individual agents manually, roles that define the different access levels can be created. The agents can then be added to one or more roles, with their access rights being modified automatically. If a new agent account is created, it is also possible to add this account to one or more roles.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Roles are really useful when dealing with complex organizations and when maintaining larger OTRS installations. Proper care is advised though. Mixing Agent to Group with Agent to Role mappings can make for a complex access control scheme, that is difficult to understand and maintain. If you wish to use only roles and disable the Agents &lt;-&gt; Groups option in the Admin area, you can do so by modifying the <link  linkend="Framework:Frontend::Admin::ModuleRegistration:Frontend::Module_AdminUserGroup">Frontend::Module###AdminUserGroup</link> in the SysConfig. Be aware that this won't remove already existing Agents to Group assignments!
</para>
</note>

OTRS supports different types of users. Using the link "Customers" (via the navigation bar, or the Admin page), you can manage the accounts of your customers (see Figure below), who can log into the system via the Customers interface (customer.pl). Through this interface, your customers can not only create tickets but also review their past tickets for new updates. It is important to know that a customer is needed for the ticket history in the system.

<title>Customer Groups</title>

<para>
Customer users can also be added to a group, which can be useful if you want to add customers of the same company with access to one or a few queues. First create the group to which your customers will belong, via the <link linkend="adminarea-groups">Group management module</link>. Then add the <link linkend="adminarea-queue">queues</link> and select the new group for the queues.
</para>

<para>
The next step is to activate the customer group support. This can be done with the configuration parameter <link linkend="Framework:Frontend::Customer:CustomerGroupSupport">CustomerGroupSupport</link>, from the Admin SysConfig option. Using the parameter <link linkend="Framework:Frontend::Customer:CustomerGroupAlwaysGroups">CustomerGroupAlwaysGroups</link>, you can specify the default groups for a newly added customer, so that every new account will be automatically added to these groups.

You can define an unlock timeout for a queue - if an agent locks a ticket and does not close it before the unlock timeout has passed, the ticket will be automatically unlocked and made available for other agents to work on.
</para>

<para>
There are three escalation time settings that can be associated at queue level:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
    <title>Escalation - First Response Time</title>
    <listitem>
        <para>
After creation of the ticket, if the time defined here expires without any communication with the customer, either by email or phone, the ticket is escalated.
        </para>
    </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<itemizedlist>
    <title>Escalation - Update Time</title>
    <listitem>
        <para>
If there is a customer followup either via e-mail or the customer portal, that is recorded in the ticket, the escalation update time is reset. If there is no customer contact before the time defined here expires, the ticket is escalated.
        </para>
    </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<itemizedlist>
    <title>Escalation - Solution Time</title>
    <listitem>
        <para>
If the ticket is not closed before the time defined here expires, the ticket is escalated.
        </para>
    </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
With 'Ticket lock after a follow-up', you can define if a ticket should be set to 'locked' to the old owner if a ticket that has been closed and later is re-opened. This ensures that a follow up for a ticket is processed by the agent that has previously handled that ticket.
</para>

<para>
The parameter for the system address specifies the email address that will be used for the outgoing tickets of this queue. There is also the possibility to associate a queue with a salutation and a signature, for the email answers. For more detailed information, please refer to the sections <link linkend="adminarea-emailaddresses">email addresses</link>, <link linkend="adminarea-salutations">salutations</link> and <link linkend="adminarea-signatures">

A salutation is a text module for a response. Salutations can be linked to one or more queues, as described in the section about <link linkend="adminarea-queue">queues</link>. A salutation is used only if a ticket from a queue the salutation is linked to, is answered. To manage the different salutations of your system, use the "Salutations"

<para>
Another text module for a response is the signature. Signatures can be linked to a queue, as described in the section about the <link linkend="adminarea-queue">queues</link>. Please note that a signature will only be appended to a response text, if it has previously been linked to a queue. You can manage the signatures in your system by accessing the "Signatures" link of the Admin page, (see Figure below).

A filter consists of one or more criteria that must be met in order for the defined actions to be executed on the email. Filter criteria may be defined for the headers or the body of an email, e.g. search for specific header entries, such as a sender address, or on strings in the body. Even regular expressions can be used for extended pattern matching. If your filter matches, you can set fields using the X-OTRS headers in the GUI. These values will be applied when creating the ticket or follow-up message in OTRS. The Table 5-4 lists the different X-OTRS headers and their meaning.

<para>
You should specify a name for every filter rule. Filter criteria can be specified in the section "Filter Condition". Choose via the listboxes for "Header 1", "Header 2" and so on for the parts of the messages where you would like to search, and specify on the right side the values you wish to filter on. In the section "Set Email Headers", you can choose the actions that are triggered if the filter rules match. You can select for "Header 1", "Header 2" and so on to select the X-OTRS-Header and set the associated values (see Figure below).

<example id="sort-mails-into-junk">
<title>Sort spam mails into a specific queue</title>

<para>
A useful filter rule would be to let OTRS automatically move mails marked for spam ,by using a spam detection tool such as SpamAssassin, into the "Junk" queue. SpamAssassin adds the "X-Spam-Flag" header to every checked mail. When the mail is marked as spam, the Header is set to "Yes". So the filter criteria would be "X-Spam-Flag: Yes". To create a filter rule with this criteria you can insert the name as, for example, "spam-mails". In the section for "Filter Condition", choose "X-Spam-Flag:" for "Header 1" from the listbox. Insert "Yes" as value for this header. Now the filter criteria is specified. To make sure that all spam mails are placed into the "Junk" queue, choose in the section for "Set Email Headers", the "X-OTRS-Queue:" entry for "Header 1". Specify "Junk" as value for this header. Finally add the new filter rule to activate it for new messages in the system.

    Click the "Add job" button to create a new job. You first need to supply a name.
    Then you can specify how the job will be executed: automatic at fixed times (like a cronjob, this mode will operate on all tickets found by the ticket filter) or based on ticket events (right after a single ticket was modified, if it matches the ticket filter). Note that if you manually run event based jobs from the overview screen, they will operate on all tickets fund by the ticket filter.

    Finally, the ticket can be modified by setting various ticket fields like a new queue or state. It is possible to attach a note to the ticket(s) or run a execute a customized module. You also have the option to delete the ticket(s) from the database. This can be useful to purge outdated or invalid data from the system.

<para>
    After editing a job, OTRS will return to the overview screen. There you have the possibility to run any job manually. If you choose to run a job, you will first see all tickets which will be affected when the job actually is run. This list helps you to verify that the job is working as intended. At this point no changes have been made to these tickets yet. Only if you confirm the screen the job will be executed.
