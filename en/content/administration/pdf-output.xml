<title>Customizing the PDF output</title>

<para>
This section handles the configurable options for PDF output in OTRS.
</para>

<para>
If you use the Print action from anywhere within the OTRS interface, it will generate a formatted PDF file. You can deactivate this by modifying the configuration parameter <link linkend="Framework:Core::PDF:PDF">PDF</link> to create HTML output instead.
</para>

<para>You can adjust the look of the files generated by OTRS by creating your own logo and adding it to <link linkend="Framework:Core::PDF:PDF::LogoFile">PDF::LogoFile</link>. You can use <link linkend="Framework:Core::PDF:PDF::PageSize">PDF::PageSize</link> to define the standard page size of the generated pdf file (DIN-A4 or Letter), and also <link linkend="Framework:Core::PDF:PDF::MaxPages">PDF::MaxPage</link> to specify the maximum number of pages for a pdf file, which is useful if a user generates a huge output file by mistake.
</para>

<para>
The Perl CPAN modules PDF::API2 and Compress::Zlib must be installed for the generation of pdf files. In many distributions they are available as packages and can be easily installed, using the respective package manager. In case
this is not possible, they have to be installed with CPAN. For further information about installing Perl modules,
please refer to the <link linkend="installation-of-perl-modules">"Installation of Perl modules"</link> section.
