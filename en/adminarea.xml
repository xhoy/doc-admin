<title>The admin area of OTRS</title>

<sect1 id="adminarea-general">
<title>Basics</title>

<para>
The admin area of OTRS is the central part in the web interface for the
OTRS administrator. All important settings for the system can be done,
changed and viewed via this module.
</para>

<para>
The admin area is reachable via the "Admin" link in the navbar of the agent
interface. The link is only displayed, if you are logged in as OTRS
administrator or if you are a member of the admin group. After a default
installation you can log in as OTRS admin with the username root@localhost
and the passworr root.
</para>

<warning>
<para>
Please change this password as fast as possible via the

<link linkend="user-preferences">
user preferences
</link>

page, because this password is set per default on new OTRS systems.

<sect2 id="adminarea-roles">
<title>Roles</title>

<para>
Roles are a very powerful and helpful feature to manage and change the
access rights of many users very simply and quickly. On big and complex
systems with many users, groups and queues this feature is very useful and
helps to save time.
</para>

<para>
To explaine the advantages of the role feature imagine that you have a
system with 100 users. 90 users have access to a queue called "support"
that contains some sub queues. All support requests are handled through
this queue. All other queues of the system are not accessible for the 90
users. The other 10 users may access all queues of the system, they are not
restricted only to the support queue. they dispatch tickets, watch the raw
queue and move spam messages into the "junk" queue. Some day the company
opens a new department that sells products. Offerings, confirmations of
offerings, bills, e.g. must be created and some of the agents in your
system shall do this via OTRS. The different users have to get access to
the new queues that must be created. Because it would take a long time to
change the access rights for the different users manualy, roles can be
created that define the different access levels. Then the users can be
added to one or more roles and the user rights get for this user accounts
get changed. If a new user account is created it is also possible to add
this account to one or more roles.

OTRS supports different types of users. The link "Customer Users" can be
used to mange the accounts of your customers. A customer can log in the
system via the customer interface (customer.pl). The customer interface
enables a user to manage own tickets and change the own account settings.
Also a customer user is needed for the ticket history in the system.

You can search for a specific customer user in the database and change the
customer user backend. More infos about customer user backends are available
in the chapter about


<link linkend="external-backends">

</link>.
</para>

<para>
You can create new customer user accounts. All input fields that are marked
through an asterisk (*) have to contain values. Very important is to
specify a account name and a password for the new user to enable that this
user can log in the system. Also you have to specifiy a customer ID
("Customer#"). This ID needs the system to identify the user and the
tickets of this user. Ffor example the mail address of the user can be
specifyed for Customer#, because a mail address is explicit.
</para>

<note>
<para>
To keep the consistency of the data for OTRS it is not possible to delete a
customer user. To deactivate a customer user account set it to
"invalid" or "invalid-temporarily".

<sect2 id="adminarea-customer-user-groups">
<title>Customer groups</title>

<para>
Customer users can also be added to a group. this feature might be useful,
if you want to add some customer users of the same company that shall only
have access to one or some queues through the customer interface. First
create via the


<link linkend="adminarea-groups">
group management module
</link>

the group, that shall contain all customer users of the company. Then
create the

<link linkend="adminarea-queue">
queues

</para>

<para>
The next step is to activate the customer group support. This can be done
with the configuration parameter

<link linkend="Framework:Frontend::Customer:CustomerGroupSupport">
CustomerGroupSupport
</link>

either via the graphical configuration frontend of OTRS or via inserting
this parameter into your <filename>Kernel/Config.pm</filename> file.
The parameter

<link linkend="Framework:Frontend::Customer:CustomerGroupAlwaysGroups">
CustomerGroupAlwaysGroups
</link>

you can specify the groups for a new added customer user, the new account
will be added to this group automaticly.

<para>
If a ticket was locked by an agent, you can specify a time interval when
the ticket is unlocked automaticly by the system.
</para>

<para>
If you specify a escalation time tickets which are older than this time
block newer tickets to and the escalated tickets have to be processed
first. This setting is usefull to force the processing of older tickets,
new tickets don't apear in the QueueView if a ticket is escalated.
</para>

<para>
Also you can specify that the old owner of a processed ticket is
automaticly the owner again, if a followup of the old ticket is send to
the ticket system. This feature makes sure that a folowup for a ticket is
first shown to the origianl owner of the ticket who already knows the facts
of this ticket.
</para>

<para>
The parameter for the system address sets the mail address that is used for
the outgoing tickets of this queue. With the salutation and signature

<title>Salutations, signatures, attachments and responses</title>

<para>
To accelerate answering tickets and to standardize the look of answers you
can define responses in OTRS. A response can be linked to one or more
queues, a queue can be linked to one or more responses. To make it possible
to use a response quickly the different responses are displayed below of
every ticket in the QueueVie or in "My Queues".
</para>

<para>
After a a default installation of the system the "empty answer" response is
defined for every queue. Through the "Responses" link it is possible to
manage the different responses.

</para>

<para>
To add or remove response to one or more queues the "Responses &lt;-&gt; Queues"
link can be used.
</para>

<para>
If you use a response for example through the QueueView you can see, that
not only the text of the response and the ticket text is displayed but also
a salutation and a signature. A response is assembled by different text
modules. The signature and the salutation of the queue where the ticket is
stored are two of the text modules of the response and also the original
ticket text and, if defined, the text of the response is included. The
different text modules are ordered that first the salutation is displayed,
then the quoted ticket text then the text of the response and after all
these text modules the signature is shown.
</para>

<sect2 id="adminarea-salutations">
<title>Salutations</title>

<para>
A text module for a response is the salutation. Salutations can be linked
to one or more queues as described in the section about

<link linkend="adminarea-queue">
queues
</link>

. Only if a salutation is linked to a queue it is used if a ticket from
this queue is answered. The "Salutations" link lets you manage the
different salutations of your system.

<graphic srccredit="Adminarea salutation - screenshot" scale="40" fileref="screenshots/admin-salutation.png"></graphic>

</para>

<para>
After a default installation there are already two salutations available in
the system, "system standard salutation (de/buiss)" and
"system standard salutation (en)".
</para>

<para>
Because the content of a salutation can be created dynamicaly, for example
for things that change for every ticket (e.g. the name or mail address of
the sender), it is possible to use variables in salutations. The text which
is saved in the variables will be placed in the response text if you reply
to a ticket.
</para>

<para>
The different variables you can use in responses are listed in the lower
part of the salutation screen. If you use for example the variable
&lt;OTRS_LAST_NAME&gt; the lastname of the sender of the ticket will be
included in your reply.
</para>

<note>
<para>
To keep the consistency of the data for OTRS it is not possible to delete a
salutation. To deactivate a salutation set it to
"invalid" or "invalid-temporarily".

<sect2 id="adminarea-signatures">
<title>Signatures</title>

<para>
Another text module for a response is the signature. Signatures can be
linked to a queue as described in the section about the

<link linkend="adminarea-queue">
queues
</link>

. Only if a signature is linked to a queue it will be included into the
response text. Through "Signatures" link you can manage the signatures in
your system.

<para>
After a default installation of OTRS there are already two signatures
stored in your system, "system standard signature (de/buiss)" and
"system standard signature (en)".
</para>

<para>
Like salutations signatures also can contain dynamical content (e.g. the first and
last name of the agent who answers the ticket), also variables replace
the content of the signature text for every ticket. See the lower part of
the signatures screen for the variables which can be used. If you include
the variable &lt;OTRS_LAST_NAME&gt; in a signature for example, the last
name of the agent who answers the ticket will be included in the signature
text.

Um aus OTRS heraus Emails verschicken zu können, benötigen Sie
mindestens eine gültige Mailadresse. Da in vielen Fällen eine
Mailadresse nicht ausreicht, ist OTRS auch in der Lage, mit mehreren
Mailadressen zu arbeiten. Für jede Queue kann mindestens eine Mailadresse
festgelegt werden, es ist aber auch möglich eine Adresse mehreren Queues
zuzuordnen. D.h., dass von außen eine Queue über mehrere Mailadressen
ereicht werden kann, für das Versenden von Nachrichten aus einer Queue muss
jedoch eine Adresse festgelegt werden. Beim

<link linkend="adminarea-queue">
Anlegen oder Bearbeiten einer Queue
</link>

stellen Sie ein, welche im System gespeicherte Mailadresse für die
ausgehenden Nachrichten der entsprechenden Queue benutzt werden soll.
Die Verwaltung der Mailadressen des Systems erreichen Sie, indem sie im
Admin-Bereich dem Link "Email Adressen" folgen.

Im Formular zur Verwaltung der Emailadressen können Sie u.a. direkt
auswählen, mit welcher Queue oder Unter-Queue die neue Mailadresse
verknüpft werden soll. Diese Verknüpfung ist wichtig, da so eingehende

werden können.

Um die Konsistenz der von OTRS verwalteten Daten sicher zu stellen,
kann eine einmal im System angelegte Mailadresse nicht entfernt werden.
Um eine Mailadresse trotzdem systemweit zu deaktivieren, setzen Sie in den

"Gültig" den Wert entweder auf "ungültig" oder
"ungültig-temporär".

Es gibt mehrere Möglichkeiten, Mails in OTRS einzuspeißen. Neben
der Nutzung des PostMaster.pl-Skripts, welches die Mails direkt in das
System piped, können auch POP3-Konten abgefragt werden, an die Mails
für Ihr Ticket-System gehen. Über den Link "PostMaster POP3

POP3-Konten, die OTRS automatisch auf neue Nachrichten überprüfen
soll.

</para>

<para>
Beim Anlegen eines neuen POP3-Accounts, muss der POP3-Server, ein Login und
ein Kennwort angegeben werden. Wählen Sie für "Vertraut" den Wert "Ja"
aus, dann werden die sog. X-OTRS-Header-Einträge ausgewertet und
angewendet, falls derartige Headereinträge in einer abgerufenen Nachricht
vorhanden sind. Da mit Hilfe der X-OTRS-Header einige Dinge am System
beinflusst werden können, sollten Sie "Vertraut" nur auf "Ja" setzen, wenn
Sie genau wissen, von welchem Absendern die abgerufenen Nachrichten stammen.
X-OTRS-Header werden vom

<link linkend="adminarea-postmasterfilter">
Modul für die Nachrichtenfilterung
</link>

in OTRS benutzt, die X-OTRS-Header werden

<link linkend="table-of-x-otrs-headers">

näher beschrieben. Es spielt keine Rolle, welcher Wert für "Vertraut"
ausgewählt wurde, eventuell eingerichtete Filterregeln für eingehende Mails
werden trotzdem abgearbeitet.
</para>

<para>
Weiterhin können Sie die Verteilung der abgerufenen Mails durch die
Angabe steuern, ob die neuen Nachrichten nach dem To-Feld oder nach der
Queue im System einsortiert werden sollen. Wählen Sie "Verteilung nach
ausgewählter Queue" aus, landen die abgerufenen Mails auf jeden Fall in der
Queue, die zusätzlich in der dafür vorgesehenen Listbox angegeben werden
kann. Dabei spielt es keine Rolle, an welche Adresse die Mail geschickt
wurde. Wählen Sie "Verteilung nach To: Feld" aus, wird überprüft, welcher
Queue die Adresse zugeordnet ist, an die die abgerufene Mail gesendet
wurde. Die Zuordnung einer Mailadresse zu einer Queue, kann über die

<link linkend="adminarea-emailaddresses">
Mailadressen Verwaltung
</link>

vorgenommen werden. Existiert eine Zuordnung
der Adresse im To: Feld zu einer Queue innerhalb des Systems wird die
abgerufene Nachricht in die entsprechende Queue einsortiert. Kann keine
Zuordnung gefunden werden, landet das Ticket in der Standard-Queue des
Systems (Raw), die mit Hilfe des Konfigurationsparameters

Eine Filterregel besteht aus einem oder mehreren Kriterien die erfüllt
werden müssen, damit die Filterregel greift, und aus einer oder mehreren
Aktionen die ausgeführt werden, nachdem die Filterkriterien erfüllt wurden.
Sie können für die Kopfzeilen und den Body einer Nachricht Filterregeln
festlegen, also z.B. nach bestimmten Headern suchen oder nach Zeichenketten
bzw. regulären Ausdrücken innerhalb der Mail. Alle Aktionen für eine
Filterregel werden über sog. X-OTRS-Header gesteuert, die in die Mail
eingefügt werden. Das Ticket-System wertet die X-OTRS-Header aus und nimmt
die entsprechenden Aktionen vor. Mit den X-OTRS-Headern kann z.B. die
Priorität einer Nachricht geändert werden, die Mail in eine bestimmte
Queue einsortiert oder die Mail komplett verworfen werden, usw. Die
folgende Tabelle listet die verschiedenen X-OTRS-Header, deren zulässige
Werte und die Bedeutung der einzelnen Header auf.

Eine nützliche Filterregel könnte sein, alle Mails, die von spamassassin

"X-Spam-Flag" hinzu. Wird die Mail als Spam markiert, wird dieser Header
auf "Yes" gesetzt. Das Filterkriterium lautet also "X-Spam-Flag: Yes". Um nun
eine Filterregel mit diesem Kriterium zu erzeugen, tragen Sie hierzu als
Name für die Filterregel z.B. "spam-mails" ein und wählen in der Sektion
"Treffer" für "Header 1" den Header "X-Spam-Flag:" aus der Listbox aus.
Rechts daneben fügen Sie als Wert "Yes" hinzu. Das Filterkriterium wurde

<title>Paket Verwaltung</title>

<para>
Seit Version 2.0 besteht OTRS aus einem zentralen Framework und mehreren
Zusatzpaketen, um die das System wahlweise erweitert werden kann. An
zusätzlichen Paketen stehen z.B. ein web-basierter Filemanager, ein
Web-Mailer, ein Content-Manager oder ein Tool zur Überwachung von
verschiedenen Betriebssystemparametern zur Verfügung. Um die Installation
der verschiedenen Komponenten zu erleichtern, können diese mit Hilfe des
Paket Managers bequem über das Web-Interface von OTRS installiert oder
entfernt werden. Die Paket Verwaltung erreichen sie über den Link
"Paket Verwaltung".

Die Pakete, die über die Paket Verwaltung hinzugefügt oder entfernt werden
können, müssen im sog. opm-Format vorliegen, andere Formate werden nicht
unterstützt. Es können mehrere Installations-Quellen angegeben werden, über
die die opm-Pakete installiert werden können. Steht Ihnen ein Paket lokal
zur Verfügung und kann darauf über das Filesystem der Maschine zugegriffen
werden, auf der OTRS installiert ist, können Sie im Eingabefeld für "Paket"
die genaue Lokation zu diesem Paket angeben, also den absoluten Pfad
gefolgt vom Dateinamen des opm-Pakets. Mit Hilfe des Schalters
"Installieren" unterhalb des Eingabefeldes, wird das Paket in die
vorhandene OTRS-Installation integriert. D.h., es werden die benötigten
Dateien kopiert, Icons und Ausgabevorlagen installiert und ggf. die Datenbank
angepasst. Ist dieser Vorgang beendet, kann das neu installierte Modul
genutzt werden.

Um immer Zugriff auf die aktuellen Versionen der zusätzlichen Module zu
haben, empfielt es sich, die Pakete über ein Online-Repository
einzuspielen. Die neueste Modulliste des Online-Repositorys erhalten Sie,
indem Sie aus der Listbox für "Quelle" den Server auswählen, von dem die
Daten des Repositorys heruntergeladen werden sollen. Verwenden Sie den
"Aktualisieren"-Schalter, um die Daten auf den neuesten Stand zu bringen.
Nach kurzer Zeit werden auf der rechten Seite im Abschnitt für das Online
Repository die Module aufgelistet, die online für eine Installation zur
Verfügung stehen. In der rechten Spalte dieser Tabelle können Sie den
"Installieren"-Schalter verwenden, um das entsprechende Modul in Ihr System
zu integrieren. Hängt das Modul von der Installation anderer Module ab, erhalten
Sie einen entsprechenden Hinweis. War die Installation eines Moduls
erfolgreich, wird das Modul in den Abschnitt für das lokale Repository
übertragen und dort aufgeführt. Das lokale Repository listet also alle
Module auf, die sie zusätzlich über die Paket Verwaltung Ihrer
Installation hinzugefügt haben.

<para>
Benötigen Sie einmal ein bestimmtes Modul nicht mehr und wollen es
entfernen, so ist dies über den "deinstallieren"-Schalter rechts vom
entsprechenden Modul innerhalb des lokalen Repositorys möglich. Auch bei
diesem Vorgang werden eventuelle Abhängigkeiten beachtet.
