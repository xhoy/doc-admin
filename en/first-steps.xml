<title>First steps in OTRS</title>

<abstract>
<para>
This chapter 's goal is to give a quick overview about how OTRS is working and how
the web interface is structured. The differences between agents, customers
and administrators are explained , and the first login as OTRS admin will be
accomplished to take a closer look at the user preferences which are
available for every account.
</para>
</abstract>

<sect1 id="agent-interface">
<title>Agent web interface</title>

<para>
All agents use the agent web interface to work with OTRS. Agents answer the
customer requests, create new tickets for customers or other agents, write
tickets about telephone calls with customers, write FAQ entries or edit
customer data, etc.
</para>

<para>
Soposing that your OTRS host is reachable via the URL

<ulink url="http://www.example.com/">
<citetitle>http://www.example.com</citetitle>

, then the agents and also the OTRS administrator can reach the login screen by
using the address

<ulink url="http://www.example.com/otrs/index.pl">
<citetitle>http://www.example.com/otrs/index.pl</citetitle>

<title>Public web interface</title>

<para>
In addition to the web interfaces for agents and customers, OTRS has a public
web interface (see Figure 4.3 below) that is available through the FAQ-Module (must be installed
separately). It provides public access to the FAQ system, and lets visitors
search through the FAQ entries without any authorization.

<para>
Access to the login screen, as described in the section about

<link linkend="agent-interface">

</link>
</para>

<para>
The login screen lets you enter a user name and a password. Because no users are
created after a fresh installation of the system, you have to login as OTRS
administrator first, using "root@localhost" for username and "root" for password.
</para>

<warning>
<para>
This account data is valid on every new installed OTRS system. For
that reason you should change the password for the OTRS administrator as
soon as possible! This can be done via the

<link linkend="user-preferences">
preferences
</link>

for the OTRS administrator account.
</para>
</warning>

<para>
If you don't want to login as OTRS administrator just enter the user name and
password for your normal agent account.
</para>

<para>
If you have forgotten your password, you can get a new password through the
system. Just press in the link below the login button and enter the mail address
that is registered for you OTRS account into the input field and press the submit
button (see Figure 4.4).

<title>An overview to the web interface</title>

<para>
After you have successfully logged into the system, the web interface is loaded.
Per default you are in the Dashboard after the login (see Figure 4.5 below).
The Dashboard is completely customizable. At the beginnig it shows your locked tickets,
allows direct access to the views: queue, status and escalation, and also to
create new phone and e-mail tickets. Besides, it gives you a quick summary of the tickets
which are: pending, escalated, new and open, among other things.

</para>

<para>
To improve the clarity, the web interface is separated into different areas.
At the very top of the windows, there is some general information, like the
current username, the logout button, icons that show the amount of locked tickets and
allow direct access to them, links to create a new phone/e-mail ticket. It also gives
you the change to go to the queue, status and escalation views.
</para>

<para>
Below the icons is the navigation bar. It shows buttons that enable you to
navigate to different areas or modules of the system and let you execute
some global actions. By pressing the Dashboard button, you can go to the dashboard
(default start page, after login). If you click on the Ticket button, you will get
a submenu with the different valid operations, like changing the ticket's view,
create a new ticket (phone/e-mail) or search for a specific ticket.
The Statistics button is also a menu that allows choosing from having an overview
of the registered statistics, create a new one or import an existing one. The
Customers button leads you to the Customer Managment. By clicking the Admin button,
you can access to all the administrator modules, where you can, e.g. create new agents,
queues, etc. There is also a Search button to make ticket searches.
</para>

<para>
If some additional application are installed, e.g. the file manager or the web mailer,
buttons to reach this applications are also displayed.
</para>

<para>
The red bar below the navbar shows different system messages. If you are
logged in as OTRS administrator you get a message, that you should not work
as administrator.
</para>

<para>
Below the title of the section you are currently in, there are several subsections (each
of them in a separate box), which can be dragged and dropped to reallocate them, as long
as they remain in the same column. In order to drag the single elements, you need to place
the cursor in the header of the element.
</para>

<para>
In the left column you can see the data about some tickets (if available), clasified in:
reminder, escalated, new and open. In each of the categories, you are also able to see
all tickets you are allowed to access or how many tickets you have locked and how many are
located in "My Queues".
</para>

<para>
"My Queues" are the queues, that you want to observe more attentive. You can select them
in your
<link linkend="user-preferences">
account preferences
</link>
.
</para>

<para>
In the right column you can find the current settings, which will be expanded/hidden by pressing
in the Settings area, as shown in the Figure 4.6 (this section is fixed, so you can not drag and
drop it). Once you accessed to the settings, you can check/unchecked the items and save your changes.

<sect1 id="what-is-a-queue">
<title>What is a queue?</title>

<para>
Because queues are very important in OTRS, this section tries to explain
more detailed their meaning.
</para>

<para>
On common mail systems all messages are into an inbox file. An inbox is a
big file where the messages are stored. New messages are appended at the
end of the inbox file. The mail program, which is used to read and write mails,
reads the inbox file and presents the content to the user.
</para>

<para>
A queue in OTRS, is somehow comparable to an inbox file, but has some extra
features. It also can store many messages, but the mails are saved in
another way. You don't need to know any detail of queues if you only want
to use OTRS, the only important thing to know is in which queue a ticket is
stored. The users of OTRS, better called agents, can open and edit tickets
in a queue and of course they can move tickets from one queue to another.
But why should they move tickets?
</para>

<para>
To explain it more practically, remember Max's company describe in the
section about a

<link linkend="basic-tts-example">
example of a ticket system
</link>

. Max installed OTRS to get rid of his support chaos. His agents and himself
are using the system to manage the support requests for the video
recorders.
</para>

<para>
One queue that contains all request is enough for this situation. However, after some
time, Max decides to also sell DVD recorders.
Now, the customers not only have questions about the video recorder, but also about the
new product. More and more emails get into the one queue of Max's OTRS and
it's hard to keep the overview.
</para>

<para>
One day, Max decides to optimize the structure of his support system and adds two
new queues, thus now three queues are used. Into the old queue ("raw") all mails are
stored if they arrive at the ticket system. The two new queues are one for
the video recorder ("video recorder") and the other one for the dvd recorder
requests ("dvd recorder").
</para>

<para>
Max asks Sandra to watch the "raw" queue and sort (dispatch) the mails either into
"video recorder" or "dvd recorder", depending on what the customer is asking.
John only has access to the "video reorder" queue, Joe can
only answer tickets in the "dvd recorder" queue. Max is able to edit
tickets in all queues.
</para>

<para>
Because OTRS supports access management for users,
groups and roles, it is easy to setup queues that only are accessible for
some specific accounts. Max could also use another way to get his requests
into the different queues, with filter rules or if two different mail
addresses are used Sandra only has to dispatch emails into the two other
queues, that can't be dispatched automatically.
</para>

<para>
Sorting your incoming messages into different queues helps you to keep the
support system structured and tidy. Because your agents are arranged into
different groups with different access rights onto queues, the system can
be optimized even more. Queues can be used to define work flow processes or
to create the structure of a company. Max could implement, for example,
another queue called "sales", which could contain the sub queues "requests",
"offers", "orders", "billing", etc. Such a queue structure could help Max
to optimize his order transactions.
</para>

<para>
The better a system is structured, the less time is needed for the different
tasks. That results in less working time, consequently less money. Queues can
help to optimize the processes in your company.
</para>

<sect1 id="user-preferences">
<title>User preferences</title>

<para>
Many settings of a user account in OTRS can be configured to their own needs
via the user preferences. Customers, agents and the OTRS administrator have
the possibility to adjust their own account preferences. The preferences page
can be reached via the "Preferences" link in the customer or agent
interface.

An agent can adjust the interface language, the theme, the default
dictionary and the view for the queues. Also the refresh period for the
interface, the maximal count of shown tickets per page and the screen that
should be displayed after a new ticket is created can be set. It is
possible to change the password and select the events when the system
shall send a notification to the email address, that is registered for your
account.
</para>

<para>
The queues, that you want to monitor in your "My Queues" settings, can also
be selected in the user preferences. You should only select such queues that
are important for you.
