    <title>Generic Interface</title>
    <para>
        The OTRS Generic Interface consists of a multiple layer framework that lets
OTRS communicate with other systems via a web service. This communication
could be in two different directions:

requests from the External System, processing the information, performing
the requested action, and answering the request.

        <para>
            A Web Service is a communication method between two systems, in our case
OTRS and a Remote System.
         </para>
         <para>
            The heart of the Web Service is its configuration, where is defined what
actions the web service can perform internally (Operation), what can actions
the OTRS request can perform Remote System (Invokers), how data is converted
from one system to the other (Mapping), and over which protocol the
communication will take place (Transport)
         </para>
         <para>
             The Generic Interface is the framework that makes it possible to create Web
Services for OTRS in a pre-defined way, using already made building blocks
that are independent from each other and interchangeable.
