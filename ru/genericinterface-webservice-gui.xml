    <para>
        The web service graphical user interface (GUI) is a tool that allows to
construct complex web service configurations in a friendly and nice
interface. It allows to:

            The "Web Services" link in the main screen of Admin Interface (in the System
Administration box) leads to the web services overview screen, where you are
able to manage your web service configurations. You can add new web services
or change the configuration of the existing ones from this screen.
        </para>
        <para>
            Every web service configuration screen has in the upper part of the screen a
navigation path in a "bread crumbs" style. This navigation path is useful to
know exactly in which part of the web service configuration we are, and also
we can jump back to any level of the configuration at any time (this action
will not save any changes).

        <note>
            <para>
                To create a new web service, press the button "Add web service", and provide
the needed information.

                The "Export web service" button gives you the opportunity to dump the
configuration of the current web service into a YAML file, download it and

migrate the web service from one server to another, for example from a
testing environment to a production system.

the file name is MyWebservice.yml the resulting web service will be named
MyWebservice). If a web service is registered in the system with the same
name as the web service that you want to import, the system will lead you to
the web service change screen to let you change the name of the imported web

                Every change to the web service configuration creates a new entry in the web
service history (as a journal). The web service history screen displays a
list of all configuration versions for a web service. Each row (version) in
the "Configuration History List" represents a single revision in the web
service history.

            <para>
                Click on one of the rows to show the whole configuration as it was on that
particular date / time. The configuration will be shown in the "History

selected web service configuration version or to restore that version into
the current web service configuration.
            </para>
            <para>
                The "Export web service configuration" behaves exactly as the "Export web

                If changes to the current web service configuration does not work as

the "Revert web service configuration" button. This will open a dialog to
ask you if you are sure to revert the web service configuration. Click
"Revert web service configuration" in this dialog to replace the current
configuration with the selected version, or click "Cancel" to close the

                Returning to the web service change screen, now we are going to review the
right side of it. Here we have the possibility to modify all the general
data for a web service such as name, description, debug threshold, etc. Also
there are two more sections below that allows us to modify specific
parameters for communication types "OTRS as Provider" and "OTRS as
Requester".

            <para>
                The web service configuration needs to be saved on each level. This means
that if a setting is changed, links to other, deeper parts of the
configuration will be disabled forcing to save the current configuration
level. After saving the disabled links will be re-enabled again allowing you
to continue with the configuration.

            <para>
                On the "OTRS as provider" section it is possible to set or configure the
network transport protocol. Only network transport backends that are
registered are shown on the list. To configure the network transport click
on the "Configure" button.  It is also possible to add new operations in

                In future the list of available network transports will be
increased. Currently only the "HTTP::SOAP" transport is available. Each
transport has different configuration options to setup and they might use
different frontend modules to configure it, but mostly they should look
similar to the "HTTP::SOAP" transport configuration module.
            </para>
            <para>
                For "HTTP::SOAP" protocol as provider the configuration is quite simple.
There are only two settings: "Namespace" and "Maximum message length". These
fields are required. The first one is a URI to give SOAP methods a context,
reducing ambiguities, and the second one it's a field where you can specify
the maximum size (in bytes) for SOAP messages that OTRS will process.

                The actions that can be performed when you are using OTRS as a provider are
called "Operations". Each operation belongs to a controller. Controllers are
collections of operations or invokers, normally operations from the same
controller need similar settings and shares the same configuration
dialog. But each operation can have independent configuration dialogs if
needed.
            </para>
            <para>
                Name, Description, Backend, and Mappings are fields that normally appear on

configuration dialogs to fulfill specific needs of the operation.
            </para>
            <para>
                Normally there are two mapping configuration sections on each operation, one
for the incoming data and another one for the outgoing data. You can choose
different mapping types (backends) for each mapping direction, since their
configuration is independent from each other and also independent from the
operation backend. The normal and most common practice is that the operation
uses same mapping type in both cases (with inverted configuration). The
complete mapping configuration is done in a separate screen which depends on
the mapping type.
            </para>
            <para>
                The operation backend is pre-filled and is not editable. You will see this
parameter when you choose the operation on the web service edit screen. The
field is only informative.

            <para>
                In the left part of the screen on the action column you have the options:
"Go back to web service" (discarding all changes since the last save) and

you like to remove the operation. Click on "Delete" button to confirm the
removal of the operation and it configuration or "Cancel" to close the

                    Event triggers are events within OTRS such as "TicketCreate", "ArticleSend",
etc.  These can act as triggers to execute the invoker. Each invoker needs
to have at least one event trigger registered, or the invoker will be
useless, because it will never be called. The asynchronous property of the
event triggers define if the OTRS process will handle the invoker or if it
will be delegated to the Scheduler.

                    <para>
                        The OTRS Scheduler is a separated process that executes tasks in the
background.  Using this the OTRS process itself will not be affected if the
Remote System takes a long time to respond, if it is not available or if
there are network problems. If you don't use the scheduler using web
services can make OTRS slow or non-responsive. Therefore it is highly
recommend to use asynchronous event triggers as often as possible.

used to interact with a Remote System, that is highly probable that is not
another OTRS system and / or could not understand the OTRS data structures
and values. In these cases some or all values has to be changed, and
sometimes even the names of the values (keys) or sometimes the complete
structure, in order to match with the expected data on the other end. To
accomplish this task the the Generic Interface Mapping Layer exists.
