This list contains suggestions for improvements and new ideas for the
OTRS admin manual.

2.2:

- translate glosary.xml into English
- translate subsection for the installation on RHEL4 in the file
  installation-and-basic-configuration.xml into English
- create a sub section for server and client hard and software requirements
  (include an item that states about OTRS with mobile devices)
- Add description of the installation procedure for MSSQL to installation
  description
- Rework external-backends.xml and include new LDAP features
- Write a chapter about the usage of a MirrorDB to speed up searches
- Write a chapter about customization of the customer web interface
- Write a chapter about the different ticket number generators
- Write a chapter about timezone feature, add timezone feature to the
  description for queues
- Write a chapter how to submit a bug in bugzilla (maybe seperate HowTo)
- Write a step to step OTRS setup description:

  * queue structure
  * users and groups
  * email addresses
  * auto answers
  * notifications
  * customizing the front-end
  * e.g.


2.5:

- Update documentation to match latest features:
  o Event Based Notification
  o Dashboard
  o ... and work on all issues which are addressed above!
- Process any Bugzilla bugs open against the Documentation:
   [http://tinyurl.com/qmlkrr]
- Check all documentation to see if it's still valid.
- Check for typos and re-write sentences if neccesary.


3.0:

- Move very specific or advanced information out of the core documentation
  to a public Wiki where it can be maintained. (for instance, information
  about using Fetchmail which is still supported but not the most easy
  way of processing email with OTRS).
- Restructure the documentation so that it will be in a more logical order.
