        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
            This feature of OTRS allows you to model processes (workflows) in the ticket
system.  The basic idea is to be able to define reoccurring processes, and
to delegate work items to different people, as well as leading the progress
of a process in different directions based on certain criteria.
        </para>

    <section>
        <title>Example</title>
        <para>
            Let's see an example to make it more demonstrative. We will define a book
order process:
        </para>

        <section>
            <title>Recording the demand</title>
            <para>
                Before an order will be placed, the demand for literature by an employee
will be recorded.  The following book is needed in our example:
            </para>
            <para>
                <screen>
Title: Prozessmanagement für Dummies
Autor: Thilo Knuppertz
ISBN: 3527703713
                </screen>
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Approval by superior</title>
            <para>
                The head of the employee's department needs to decide on the order.  In case
of a denial, a reason should be recorded by the superior.  In case of
approval, the order is passed to the purchasing department.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Processing by purchasing department</title>
            <para>
                Purchasing now has the task to find out where the book can be ordered with
the best conditions.  If it is out of stock, this can be recorded in the
order.  In case of a successful order purchasing will record the supplier,
the price and the delivery date.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Processing by the mailroom</title>
            <para>
                The shipment will arrive at the company. The incoming goods department
checks the shipment and records the date of receipt.  Now the employee will
be informed that their order has arrived and is ready to be collected.
            </para>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Implementing the example</title>
        <para>
            If we assume that a ticket acts in this workflow like an accompanying
document that can receive change notes, we already have a clear picture of
process tickets.
        </para>
        <para>
            From the analysis of the example process we can identify the following
neccessary items:
        </para>
        <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>Possiblities to record data, let's call them <emphasis>Activity
Dialogs</emphasis>,</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>checks which can react to changed data automatically, let's call them
<emphasis>Transitions</emphasis>,</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>changes which can be applied to a process ticket after successful
transitions of a process ticket, let's call them <emphasis>Transition
Actions</emphasis>.</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>
            We also need an additional item which might not be as obvious:
        </para>
        <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        A possibility to offer more than just one Activity Dialog to be available.
In our example this is needed when the superior must have the choice between
"Approve" and "Deny".  Let's call this <emphasis>Activity</emphasis>.
                </para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>
            Now, with Activities, Activity Dialogs, Transitions and Transition Actions
we have the neccessary tools to model the individual steps of our example.
To be able to refer to these entities later, we will assign to them an
abbreviation in parentheses.
        </para>

        <para>
            What's still missing is an area where for each workflow the order of the
steps can be specified.  Let's call this <emphasis>Process</emphasis>.
        </para>

        <para>
            In the next step, we will define the individual entities that we need.
        </para>

                </para>
                <para>
                    As you can see, there are places where the same TransitionAction should be
executed.  Therefore it is reasonable to make it possible to link
TransitionActions freely with Transitions to be able to reuse them. können.
                </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Activities</title>
            <para>
                We chose the approach to see Activities as a basket which can contain one or
more Activity Dialogs.  We need these Activities for our example:
            </para>
            <para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Recording the demand (A1): Contains the Activity Dialog "Recording the
demand"</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Approval (A2): Contains the Activity Dialogs "Approval denied" as well as
"Approved"</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Order (A3): Contains the Activity Dialogs "Order denied" as well as "Order
placed"</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Incoming (AS): Contains the Activity Dialog "Shipment received"</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Process complete (A5): This is an Activity without possible
ActivityDialogs.  It will be set after "Approval denied", "Order denied" or
"Shipment received" and represents the end of the process.
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
            </para>
            <para>
                Now we can clearly see that Activities are precisely defined states of a
process ticket.  After a successful Transition a process ticket moves from
one Activity to another.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Book ordering Process</title>
            <para>
                Let us conclude our example with the last missing piece in the puzzle, the
Process.  In our case this is the whole ordering workflow. Other processes
could be office supply ordering or completely different processes.
            </para>

            <para>
                The process has a starting point which consists of the start Activity and
the start Activity Dialog.  For any new book order, the start Activity
Dialog is the first screen that is displayed.  If this is completed and
saved, the Process ticket will be created and can follow the configured
workflow.
            </para>

            <para>
                The process also contains the directions for how the process ticket can move
through the Process. Let's call this the "Path". It consists of the start
Activity, one or more Transitions (possibly with Transition Actions), and
other Activities.
            </para>
            <para>Recording the demand until "Approval"</para>
            <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>Additionally, the following TransitionActions are executed:</para>
                            <itemizedlist>
                                <listitem>
                                    <para>TA1 (Moving the ticket into the "Superior" Queue)</para>
                                </listitem>
                                <listitem>
                                    <para>TA2 (Set ticket responsible to "Superior")</para>
                                </listitem>
                            </itemizedlist>
                        </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            </para>
            <para>
                That's the first step in the path of the book ordering process. It looks
like this (slightly simplified):
            </para>
            <para>
                <screen>
                'A1' => {
                    'T1' => {
                        ActivityEntityID => 'A2',
                        TransitionAction => [ 'TA1', 'TA2',],
                    },
                },
                </screen>
            </para>
            <para>
                Action 'A1' is a defined state of the process ticket, where there is the
possibility for the Transition 'T1'.  If this applies, the ticket will move
to the next Activity 'A2', and the TransitionActions 'TA1' and 'TA2' are
executed.  In Activity 'A2', the Activity Dialogs 'AD2' (Apprival denied)
and 'AD3' (Approved) are available.

                    'FadeAway' sind Processes in denen bestehende Auftragstickets noch weiterhin den Process durchlaufen können,
                    die aber für neue Auftragstickets nicht mehr zur Auswahl stehen. 'Inactive' sind deaktivierte Processes.
                    Sie stehen sowohl beim Anlegen neuer Auftragstickets nicht mehr zur Verfügung,
                    wie auch bestehende Auftragstickets die einem 'Inactive' Process zugeordnet sind,

                    Sobald das Auftragsticket erstellt wurde, wird dieses Activity gesetzt,

                    Beim anlegen eines neuen Auftragstickets muss eine klar definierte Activity Dialog vorhanden sein,
                    diese wird angezeigt sobald die Maske zur Erstellung eines neuen Auftragstickets
                    inklusive Process-Auswahl abgeschickt wurde.
                    In diesem Moment ist das Auftragsticket noch nicht erstellt,
                    erst nach absenden der StartActivityDialog wird die Auftragsticketerstellung ausgelöst.

                    Path enthält die Abbildung der zu durchlaufenden Process Activity ID's
                    sowie jeweils davon ausgehender Transition Möglichkeiten (TransitionEntityID's)
                    und dazugehöriger Ziel-Activities (ActivityEntityID's).
                    Hier wird der Weg, den ein Auftragsticket durchlaufen kann abgebildet. Beispiel:
                </para>
                <para>
                <screen>
            'A1' => {

                },
                'T2' => {
                    ActivityEntityID => 'A3',
                },
                'T3' => {

                    TransitionAction        => ['TA1', 'TA2'],
                },
            },
                </screen>
                </para>
                <para>
                    Ist ein Auftragsticket im obigen Beispiel bei Activity 'A1' angelangt,
                    hat es 3 mögliche Bedingungen um zum nächsten Activity zu gelangen.
                    In den Transitions 'T1' bis 'T3' sind Bedingungen definiert,
                    die ein Auftragsticket erfüllen muss, um eine Transition zu absolvieren.
                    Sind im obigen Fall alle nötigen Werte der Auftragsticketfelder bzw. DynamicFields für das Erfüllen
                    der Bedingung 'T2' vorhanden und zutreffend, wird der Activity Wert des Auftragstickets von A1 auf A3 umgestellt.
                    Nach jedem Speichern von Activity Dialogs erfolgt eine Prüfung auf die möglichen Transitions,
                    die laut dieser Path Konfiguration vom aktuellen Activity aus möglich sind.
                    Sollten mehrere Transitions mit den aktuellen Werten der Auftragsticket bzw. DynamicFields
                    möglich sein, greift die erste zutreffende Transition.
                    Die Reihenfolge der Transitions wird durch Alphanumerische Sortierung der Transition ID's bestimmt.

                <para>
                    Weiters ist es möglich in der Path Konfiguration eine oder mehrere TransitionActions pro möglicher Transition zu verankern.
                    TransitionActions sind Module die nach erfolgter Transition ausgeführt werden. In der Path Konfiguration müssen
                    transitionActions in Arrayform mit eckigen Klammern angegeben werden. Wird mehr als eine TransitionAction benötigt, sind diese,
                    wie im obigen Beispiel, mit Komma zu trennen. Wie TransitionActions konfiguriert werden können lesen Sie im Punkt
                    "TransitionActions".

                    Wichtig ist hierfür, dass in 'Match' als Grundbedingung
                    qr{}xms enthält. Innerhalb der geschweiften Klammern kann die Regular Expression
                    eingefügt werden. Beispiele für Regular Expresseions können unter:

                    Bietet die Möglichkeit, die mitgelieferten Werte an ein Perl Modul zur Prüfung
                    weiterzureichen. Hiermit ist dann auch alles möglich was mit Perl machbar ist.
                    Die Werte können beispielsweise für SOAP Anfragen benutzt und deren Antworten
                    auf mögliche True/False Returns überprüft werden. Wenn das Modul '1' zurückliefert
                    ist die Überprüfung positiv. Wird '0' zurückgeliefert ist die Überprüfung fehlgeschlagen.
                    Ein Beispiel für ein Modul ist in
                    /Kernel/System/ProcessManagement/TransitionValidation/ValidateDemo.pm zu finden.

                    Diese TransitionAction ändert den Status des Auftragstickets. Es ist sowohl möglich den Status generell
                    oder aber auch den Status anhand einer Fallentscheidung zu ändern. Diese Fallentscheidung
                    wird anhand eines definierten DynamicFields getroffen. Ist der Wert des definierten DynamicFields
                    zum Zeitpunkt der Ausführung der TransitionAction nicht in der Fallentscheidung enthalten geschieht nichts.

                </para>
                <para>
                    Possible gibt die Liste der erlaubten Activity Dialogs an.
                    Sind z. B. für das aktuelle Activity folgende Activity Dialogs konfiguriert: 'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3' (einstellbar in der Activity Konfiguration)
                    schränkt die obige Konfiguration die Auswahlmöglichkeit auf die Activity Dialogs 'AD1' und 'AD3' ein.
                </para>
                <para>
                    PossibleNot gibt die Liste der nicht erlaubte Activity Dialogs an.
                    Sind z. B. für das aktuelle Activity folgende Activity Dialogs konfiguriert: 'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3' (einstellbar in der Activity Konfiguration)
                    schränkt die obige Konfiguration die Auswahlmöglichkeit auf die Activity Dialogs 'AD1' und 'AD2' ein.

                <para>
                    Wird wie oben sowohl Possible als auch PossibleNot angegeben, durchläuft die Ermittlung der möglichen Activity Dialog folgende Logik:
                    Konfigurierte ActivityDialogs: 'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3'. Nach Prüfung auf Possible verbleiben die Möglichkeiten 'AD1' und 'AD3'.
                    Danach setzt PossibleNot ein und nimmt auch noch 'AD3' aus der Liste der möglichen ActivityDialogs.
                    Übrig bleibt als einzige erlaubte Activity Dialog 'AD1'.

                <para>
                    Angenommen das Auftragsticket hat den Status 'new', ist in der 'Raw' Queue und hat als Priority '3 normal'
                    treffen alle drei obigen ACL Rules zu.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Die erste ACL Rule reduziert die erlaubten Activity Dialogs von 'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3', 'AD4', 'AD5', 'AD6', 'AD7' auf
                    'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3', 'AD6', 'AD7' und verbietet somit 'AD4' und 'AD5'.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Die zweite ACL Rule reduziert die erlaubten Activity Dialogs von den nach der ersten ACL verbleibenden:
                    'AD1', 'AD2', 'AD3', 'AD6', 'AD7' auf die Activity Dialogs die sowohl in der ersten als auch in der zweiten Regel unter Possible zu finden sind.
                    In unserem Beispiel verbleiben somit 'AD2', 'AD3', 'AD7'. Die Activity Dilalog 'AD1' fällt heraus, da sie nur in der ersten Regel definiert ist.
                    Die Activity Dialog 'AD4' wird nicht in die erlaubten Activity Dialogs aufgenommen, da sie nur in der zweiten Regel definiert ist.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Nach der Reduktion der möglichen Activity Dialogs durch Possible setzt die weitere Reduktion durch PossibleNot ein.
                    In unserem Fall versucht sie die Activity Dialog 'AD3' zu verhindern, welche nach den Possibles noch vorhanden war.
                    Das Verbot von 'AD4' wirkt sich nicht aus, da diese schon vorher herausgefallen war.
                    Somit verbleiben nach PossibleNot 'AD2' und 'AD7' als mögliche Activity Dialogs.
