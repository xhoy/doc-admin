"At a meeting, a colleague tells Max about trouble ticket systems and how "
"they can solve Max's problems with customer support. After looking for "
"information on the Internet, Max decides to install the Open Ticket Request "
"System (OTRS) on a computer that is accessible from the web by both his "
"customers and his employees. Now, the customer requests are no longer sent "
"to Max's private inbox but to the mail account that is used for OTRS. The "
"ticket system is connected to this mailbox and saves all requests in its "
"database. For every new request, the system generates an auto-answer and "
"sends it to the customer so that the customer knows that his request has "
"arrived and will be answered soon. OTRS generates an explicit reference, the "
"ticket number, for every single request. Customers are now happy because "
"they receive an acknowledgement to their requests and it is not necessary to "
"send a second message with the same question. Max, John and Joe can now "
"login into OTRS with a simple web browser and answer the requests. Since the "
"system locks a ticket that is answered, no message is edited twice."

"Of course, this is only a short preview of the possibilities and features of "
"trouble ticket systems. But if your company has to attend to a high volume "
"of customer requests through mails and phone calls, and if different service "
"representatives need to respond at different times, a ticket system can be "
"of great help. It can help streamline work flow processes, add efficiencies "
"and improve your overall productivity. A ticket system helps you to flexibly "
"structure your Support or Help Desk environment. Communications between "
"customers and service staff become more transparent. The net result is an "
"increase in service effectiveness. And no doubt, satisifed customers will "
"translate into better financial results for your company."

"A trouble ticket is similar to a medical report created for a hospital "
"patient. When a patient first visits the hospital, a medical report is "
"created to hold all necessary personal and medical information on him. Over "
"multiple visits, as he is attended to by the same or additional doctors, the "
"attending doctor updates the report by adding new information on the "
"patient's health and the ongoing treatment. This allows any other doctors or "
"the nursing staff to get a complete picture on the case at hand. When the "
"patient recovers and leaves the hospital, all information from the medical "
"report is archived and the report is closed."

"Trouble ticket systems such as OTRS handle trouble tickets like normal "
"email. The messages are saved in the system. When a customer sends a "
"request, a new ticket is generated by the system which is comparable to a "
"new medical report being created. The response to this new ticket is "
"comparable to a doctor's entry in the medical report. A ticket is closed if "
"an answer is sent back to the customer, or if the ticket is separately "
"closed by the system. If a customer responds again on an already closed "
"ticket, the ticket is reopened with the new information added. Every ticket "
"is stored and archived with complete information. Since tickets are handled "
"like normal emails, attachments and contextual annotations will be stored "
"too with every email. Also, information on relevant dates, employees "
"involved, working time needed for ticket resolution etc. are also saved. At "
"any later stage, tickets can be sorted, and it is possible to search through "
"and analyze all information using different filtering mechanisms."
